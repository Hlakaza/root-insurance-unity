# Root Insurance Unity
Unity scripts for the [Root Insurance API](https://app.root.co.za/docs/insurance/api). Only supports the Gadget module at this moment.

These scripts are API wrappers, returning an object each. By default, they just output the object to the console, so you need to adapt them for your use case.

### Installing
* Go to the [releases](https://github.com/jonatasbaldin/root-insurance-unity/releases) and download the latest version.
* Double click the file to import the scripts into your project.
* In the `Auth.cs` file, add your Root API Key to the `APIKey` variable.
